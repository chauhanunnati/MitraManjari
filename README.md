MitraManjari (मित्रमंजरी) is a small cpp application which is designed to help individuals track their menstrual cycles, receive reminders for upcoming periods, record symptoms experienced during periods, and engage in fun activities to promote wellness and relaxation.
The name is a blend of "Mitra" (friend) and "Manjari" (bouquet), suggesting a diverse and supportive array of services for women.
